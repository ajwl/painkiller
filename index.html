          <li>Was it a warm winter in 2011? Spending on cough and cold medication dropped noticeably</li>
          <li>Spending on painkillers has climbed steadily since 2011, increasing by £50m (9%) in 3 years</li>
          <li>2011 was a recent low for digestive remedy spending too, it rose £13m (4%) in the 3 years after that</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Brits take a lot of systemic painkillers like Ibuprofen and paracetemol and we spent over half a billion pounds on them in 2014 (£504m)</li>
          <li>Again, 2014 had the highest systemic painkiller spend in recent years, was it a particularly painful year for Brits?</li>
          <li>We've been rubbing a whole lot more more painkillers onto ourselves recently too: spending on topical painkillers is up 33% (£24m) between 2009 and 2014</li>
          <li>We've spent increasingly more on getting to sleep since 2010, a rise of almost 20% (£9.2m) in 4 years</li>

            <li>Spending on cough remedies and throat medication has stayed pretty constant over the last five years - even falling slightly in the case of adult cough meds</li>

            <li>2010 was the peak year for laxatives - and spending has gone down slightly since then</li>
            <li>In contrast diarrhoea spending has gone up and is now almost level with laxatives, though laxatives have been ahead for the last five years. Diarrhoea spending went up 10% (£5m) between 2010 and 2014.</li>
